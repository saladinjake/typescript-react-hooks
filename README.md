# React Hooks Movie Management Application

React Hooks exercise .

----

## Main features

Your task is to complete a simple movie management application by adding 4 main features:
- Listing all the movies
- Creating a new movie by filling a form
- Deleting an existing movie
- Rating a movie using stars 1-5

Make sure that:
- all the tests pass
- you stick to the names of the props of the original components (don't refactor them), so that the automatic tests don't break
